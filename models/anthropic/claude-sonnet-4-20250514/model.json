  "description": "Claude Sonnet 4, part of the Claude 4 family, is a significant upgrade to Claude Sonnet 3.7. It excels in coding (72.7% on SWE-bench) and reasoning, responding more precisely to instructions. Sonnet 4 offers an optimal mix of capability and practicality, with enhanced steerability, and supports extended thinking with tool use.",
